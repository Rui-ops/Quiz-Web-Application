# Quiz-Web-Application

A quiz with the tomcat application server. The user enters username, password and email, which is a login/register system with database included, on a startpage before the quiz starts and each test has a default number of questions. The questions should be multiple choice checkboxes.

An additional admin interface is added where questions more questions can be added. All questions are mirrored in a mySQL-database with JPA.
